I completed this side-project in December 2015 at the request of the Free Range design consultancy.

Their designers had created an email mailer in PhotoShop, and they wanted an html version which
they could update with new content on a semi-regular basis.

Completing this project required me to:
- Extract all individual image files from the layered photoshop file  
- Use the extracted images to build each section of the newsletter in html  
- Locate each html element according to the (x,y) pixel locations in the photshop file  
- Add css styling to match their newsletter as closely as possible  
- Import their official company font files to complete the styling  
- Add placeholders for links to various photo and text tags  

This project was fun, and really tested my html and css chops!  talk about &lt;div&gt;ception...
